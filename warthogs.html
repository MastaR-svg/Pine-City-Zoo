                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, known for their distinctive tusks and rugged appearance. They inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands, often near water sources. Warthogs are well-adapted to their environment, with a tough hide that protects them from thorns and rough terrain.</p>
                    <p>These animals are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, and fruits. They have a unique feeding behavior, often using their snouts to dig for food in the ground.</p>

                    <p>Warthogs are social animals, typically found in small groups called sounders, which consist of females and their young. Males are more solitary but may join groups during the mating season. They use abandoned burrows for shelter and protection from predators.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Warthogs are commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa, inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. They prefer areas with access to water sources, such as rivers or ponds.</p>
