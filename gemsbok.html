                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope found in the arid regions of southern Africa. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to survive without water for long periods by obtaining moisture from the vegetation they consume.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are social animals, often found in herds of up to 10 individuals. They are primarily grazers, feeding on grasses and shrubs. Their keen eyesight and acute sense of hearing help them detect predators, such as lions and hyenas, from a distance.</p>

                    <p>These animals are known for their incredible endurance and can run at high speeds over long distances. They are also capable of jumping over obstacles, making them agile in their natural habitat.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are typically found in open plains, savannas, and semi-desert regions. They are well adapted to the dry conditions of the Kalahari Desert and can often be seen near waterholes during the dry season.</p>
