                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social animals that belong to the primate order. They are known for their playful behavior, agility, and complex social structures. Monkeys are found in various habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions.</p>
                    <p>There are two main groups of monkeys: New World monkeys, which are found in Central and South America, and Old World monkeys, which are native to Africa and Asia. New World monkeys have prehensile tails, which they use for grasping branches, while Old World monkeys do not. Both groups exhibit a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are known for their dexterity and intelligence, often using tools to obtain food or solve problems. They have a diverse diet that includes fruits, leaves, seeds, and insects. Monkeys are also known for their vocalizations and social interactions, which play a crucial role in their communication and bonding.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are important for their ecosystems, as they help with seed dispersal and maintaining the balance of their habitats. However, many species are threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade.</p>

                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Monkeys are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they inhabit a variety of environments, including rainforests, savannas, and mountains. They are highly adaptable and can thrive in both arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) habitats.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are known for their social behavior, living in troops or bands that can range from a few individuals to several dozen. They communicate using vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small animals.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys play a crucial role in their ecosystems as seed dispersers and prey for larger predators. They are also important for scientific research due to their genetic similarities to humans.</p>
