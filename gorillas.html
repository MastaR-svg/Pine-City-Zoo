                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are known for their strength and intelligence. They are native to the forests of central Africa and are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits. Gorillas are social animals that live in groups called troops, led by a dominant silverback</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, with several subspecies within each. They are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent animals and their habitats.</p>

                    <p>Gorillas are known for their complex social structures and communication skills. They use a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions to communicate with each other. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally gentle and shy animals.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Gorillas are typically found in tropical and subtropical forests, including montane forests and lowland rainforests. They prefer areas with dense vegetation, which provides both food and shelter.</p>
