                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
                    <p>Elephants are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and strong family bonds. They communicate using a variety of vocalizations and body language. Elephants are herbivores and spend a large part of their day foraging for food, which includes grasses, fruits, and bark.</p>

                    <p>Elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent animals and their habitats.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Elephants are found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands. They are most commonly associated with areas that have access to water sources.</p>
