                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling lifestyle. They have a thick, grayish fur coat, large round ears, and a flat nose. Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals but provide them with the necessary nutrients.</p>
                    <p>These adorable creatures are often seen sleeping in trees, as they spend most of their time resting to conserve energy. Koalas are solitary animals, typically living alone or in small groups. They communicate using a range of vocalizations, including grunts and bellows.</p>

                    <p>Koalas are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss, bushfires, and disease. Conservation efforts are in place to protect their habitats and ensure their survival in the wild.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Koalas are found in eucalyptus forests and woodlands along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia. They prefer areas with abundant eucalyptus trees, which provide both food and shelter.</p>
