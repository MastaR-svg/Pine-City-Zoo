                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals known for their majestic appearance and social behavior. They are native to Africa and parts of Asia, primarily inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.</p>
                    <p>Lions are the only big cats that live in groups called prides, which typically consist of several related.</p>

                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in the Gir Forest of India. They prefer open habitats such as savannas and grasslands, where they can hunt for prey.</p>
                    <p>Lions are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. They primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffaloes. Their social structure allows them to work together to take down larger prey.</p>
