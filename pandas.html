                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to China, known for their distinctive black and white fur. They primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of central China. Pandas are herbivorous and have a diet that consists almost entirely of bamboo, which they consume in large quantities.</p>
                    <p>These gentle giants are known for their playful behavior and are often seen climbing trees or rolling around in the grass. Pandas are solitary animals, but they do communicate with each other through vocalizations and scent markings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pandas are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss and low birth rates. Conservation efforts are in place to protect their habitats and ensure their survival in the wild. They are also a symbol of wildlife conservation efforts worldwide.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Pandas are primarily found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They inhabit bamboo forests, which provide both food and shelter.</p>
