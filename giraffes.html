                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They are native to Africa and can be found in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees.</p>
                    <p>These gentle giants have a unique coat pattern of irregular brown patches separated by lighter-colored fur. Their long necks allow them to reach high branches, giving them access to food sources that other herbivores cannot reach.</p>

                    <p>Giraffes are social animals, often found in groups called towers. They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, snorts, and hisses. Despite their size, giraffes are surprisingly agile and can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour (60 km/h) over short distances.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Giraffes are typically found in sub-Saharan Africa, inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. They prefer areas with abundant acacia trees, which provide both food and shelter.</p>
