                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>Tigers are the largest species of big cats, known for their striking orange coat with black stripes. They are native to Asia and primarily inhabit forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Tigers are solitary animals and are known for their strength and agility.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. They primarily hunt large herbivores such as deer and wild boar. Their keen sense of sight and hearing makes them effective hunters, allowing them to stalk and ambush their prey.</p>

                    <p>These magnificent creatures are also known for their vocalizations, including roars, growls, and chuffs. Tigers are territorial animals, and their territories can range from 20 to 100 square kilometers, depending on the availability of prey and habitat.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>They can be found in a range of ecosystems, including rainforests, grasslands, savannas, and even mangrove swamps. </p>
